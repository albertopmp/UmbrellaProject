## UmbrellaProject

**The purpose of this project is to get hands-on experience with AWS Services.** As I was learning to become AWS Cloud Practitioner Certified, I wanted to get my hands dirty and apply all the things I'd been learning during the preparation of the certificate.

I saw that many people have taken the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) as a way to advance their cloud career. ***Nevertheless, I wanted to do something different and develop a project of my own, solving along the way an issue that I'd been facing since I was just a little boy: always forgetting my umbrella when it rains!***

> **Moreover, I want this project to become a tool for consolidating the knowledge that I'll acquire during future training and certifications through hands-on practice.**
