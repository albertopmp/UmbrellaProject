            Purpose
          </span>
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to get hands-on experience with AWS Services. As I was learning to become AWS
        Cloud Practitioner Certified, I wanted to get my hands dirty and apply all the things I'd been learning during
        the preparation of the certificate.
      </p>

      <p>
        I saw that many people have taken the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/" target="_blank"> Cloud Resume
          Challenge</a> as a way to advance their cloud career. Nevertheless,
        I wanted to do something different and develop a project of my own, solving along the way an issue that I'd been
        facing since I was just a little boy: always forgetting my umbrella when it rains!
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, I want this project to become a tool for consolidating the knowledge that I'll acquire during future
        training and certifications through hands-on practice.

          How It Works
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        <span>Umbre??a <img src="assets/img/umbrella-img/umbrella.png" alt="umbrella-logo" class="inline-umbrella-img">
        </span> shows you whether you'll need to take your umbrella or not, just as simple as that! Additionally, you
        can subscribe with your email to recevie daily reminders so you don't forget your umbrella at home
      </p>

      <p>
        In this first iteration of the development I kept the functionality simple <b>because I wanted to focus on
          what really mattered here, the use of AWS Services.</b> Right now <span>Umbre??a <img
            src="assets/img/umbrella-img/umbrella.png" alt="umbrella-logo" class="inline-umbrella-img"> </span> only
        works for my city, Santiago de Compostela, and daily reminders are sent at 6:30 AM (Madrid)

          Architecture
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        In order to design the architecture I used the knowledge acquired throughout the certification process and I
        took the time to thoroughly read the documentation of many services. The latter was really helpful both for the
        design and the exam, as I learned the intricacies of some services and how they worked at low-level.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also want to highlight that I've only made use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free" target="_blank">AWS
          Free Tier</a>, as I wanted this project to be accessible without incurring any costs (Except for the costs of
        the domain name - Route 53)
